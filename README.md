# Accedo-TV Test
# To start:
npm install
npm start


# Notes:
  - The keyboard navigation was a bigger challenge that I expected. I didn't find any library for it, which i expected to exist.
For those reasons, while I did made the app as required, I am quite sure the solution can (and need) to be optimize. Having said that, it was fun to try to find a solution, and I am happy that I did. 


# Possibles improvements:
  - LogOut workflow needs to be created.
